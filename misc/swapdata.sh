# Usage: ./swapdata.sh
#
# For a directory with unchanging name, quickly alternate between one set of
# contents and another. Useful for testing using alternative data, and then
# switching back to the actual data when testing is done.
#
# Given 2 versions of a directory (dir), backup the current version of dir
# and replace the contents of dir with contents of the other version.
#
# Example:
# Suppose version1="FOO" and version2="BAR", and dir="DIR"
#
# Suppose that initially, before running the script:
# DIR contains version 1
# DIR_BAR contains version 2
#
# After running the script for the first time:
# DIR contains version 2
# DIR_FOO contains version 1
#
# After running the script again, we're back to the initial state:
# DIR contains version 1
# DIR_BAR contains version 2
#
# Note: the script will exit if DIR_BAR and DIR_FOO exist when it is run.


dir="data"						# set this to name of main directory
version1="1600"					# description of version 1 of dir
version2="full"					# description of version 2 of dir
